# Happy Gardener :seedling:
 A cozy gardening game that runs on the Game Boy Advanced. Players play as a gardener that needs to plant a certain amount & type of seedlings to get through each level. Players are given a set amount of fences per level to place around the garden to keep out goats :goat: from eating the crops. Pass all 3 levels to win the game! If you fill up all your plots with seedlings and didn't meet the requirement, you lose!
